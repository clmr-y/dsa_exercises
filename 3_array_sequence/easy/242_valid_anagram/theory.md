## Two Hashmaps solution
$ O(n + m) - Time $
$ O(n + m) - Space $

## Sorting Algorithm
$ O (n * log n) $

```py
return sorted(s) == sorted(t)
```

## Future Improvements

* Instead of having 2 count arrays, we can have a single count array and add +1 for s and -1 for t and finally run through each char and see if they are 0 in the count array
